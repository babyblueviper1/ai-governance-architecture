# AI Governance Project

**Version:** v0.3  
**Status:** Draft — Architecture Phase

The AI Governance Project is an evolving architectural initiative focused on capability-tiered governance frameworks and enforcement infrastructure for advanced AI systems.

**The objective is not reactive regulation, but structural clarity.**

## Premise

The term “AI” currently collapses fundamentally different system types into a single regulatory category.

Stateless predictive tools, enterprise workflow agents, economically active autonomous systems, sovereign-scale compute deployments, and decentralized rogue actors cannot coherently share the same governance regime.

**Effective governance must map to capability — not branding.**

This repository develops that framework step by step.

## Structure of the Research Series

### [Note I — The AI Agent Spectrum](./notes/note-01-ai-agent-spectrum.md)

Introduces a capability-based classification of AI systems.

**Key thesis:**  
Governance must be capability-tiered.

The note defines a spectrum based on:

- Autonomy  
- Persistence  
- Goal formation  
- Economic participation  
- Infrastructure access  
- Identity continuity  

It outlines differentiated governance modes appropriate to each class of system.

### [Note II — From Agent Spectrum to Governance Architecture](./notes/note-02-from-agent-spectrum-to-governance-architecture.md)

Builds on the spectrum model and introduces the structural implications.

**Key thesis:**  
Governance must move from declarative regulation to infrastructural architecture.

This note explores:

- Why uniform regulation fails  
- How governance attaches to leverage points  
- The emerging role of compute, energy, identity, and infrastructure  
- The early concept of enforcement as a system layer  

It introduces — but does not yet fully develop — the idea that enforcement in AI ecosystems may become partially autonomous and infrastructural.

### [Note III — Capability-Tiered Governance & Enforcement Architecture](./notes/note-03-capability-tiered-governance-enforcement.md)

Formalizes the capability spectrum and establishes enforcement as an architectural necessity.

**Key thesis:**  
As AI systems gain persistence, planning, and economic agency, governance must migrate from policy to embedded runtime architecture.

This note defines:

- **Four-tier capability spectrum**  
  - Tier 1: Assistive Systems (low/no persistence, human-directed)  
  - Tier 2: Hybrid Distributed Agency Systems (persistent memory + workflows)  
  - Tier 3: Autonomous Operational Agents (persistent identity, planning, adaptive behavior)  
  - Tier 4: Autonomous Economic Agents (capital allocation, contracts, market participation)

- **Governance Maturity Alignment** table mapping each tier to its required governance layer

- **Enforcement as Architecture** — shift to embedded constraint systems, runtime verification, and enforcement node networks

- **Conceptual Enforcement Topology** (Agent Layer → Constraint Layer → Verification Layer → Enforcement Node Network)

- Strategic position: AI governance as an **architectural synchronization challenge** between capability expansion and enforcement maturity

- Roadmap for next phases (enforcement nodes, verification topologies, economic throttling, sovereign compute, identity continuity standards)

This note completes the foundational classification-to-architecture transition and prepares the ground for concrete enforcement models.

## Direction of Inquiry

Future work will explore:

- Enforcement as a formal governance layer  
- Autonomous enforcement agents  
- Resource gating and compute access regimes  
- Sovereign compute infrastructure  
- Multilateral vs national governance architectures  
- Power concentration risks in enforcement systems  
- Governance of the enforcers  

## Project Approach

This project proceeds methodically:

- Map the terrain  
- Clarify categories  
- Identify leverage points  
- Develop structural models  
- Articulate strategic implications  

## Positioning

This repository is **not** advocacy for premature regulation.

It is an attempt to:

- Reduce category errors  
- Introduce architectural clarity  
- Anticipate structural shifts before they become reactive crises  

The work evolves toward a strategic position — but only after analytical foundations are established.

## Audience

- Governance advisors  
- Policy designers  
- Infrastructure architects  
- National security analysts  
- Institutional leaders  
- AI systems designers  

## Working Assumptions

- AI systems will increase in autonomy and persistence.  
- Economically active agents will proliferate.  
- Compute concentration will matter geopolitically.  
- Governance will increasingly attach to infrastructure.  
- Enforcement cannot remain purely declarative.  

These assumptions are examined — not asserted.

# Initiative Position

This repository represents early-stage work toward a **capability-tiered governance standard** for advanced AI systems.

## Objective

The objective is to:

- Formalize classification frameworks
- Define enforcement architecture requirements
- Develop interoperable governance primitives
- Contribute to emerging standards discourse

This is an **architectural exploration phase**.

Future iterations may include:

- Formal proposals
- Draft technical specifications
- Collaborative contributions

The work presented here — including capability tiers, design principles, enforcement topologies, and governance maturity alignment — is intended as foundational input to help shape safe, scalable, and interoperable governance architectures for increasingly autonomous AI systems.

## Collaboration & Engagement

The **AI Governance Project** is open to substantive engagement from:

- Researchers
- Institutional leaders
- Practitioners

…working at the intersection of **AI systems design** and **governance**.

This is **not** a general commentary forum. Contributions should engage meaningfully with structural, architectural, or enforcement-level questions raised in the notes and design principles.

### How to Engage

- If your work directly intersects with capability-tiered governance, enforcement architectures, identity continuity, jurisdictional awareness, interoperable enforcement nodes, or related topics → **open an issue** describing the overlap or proposed contribution.
- For deeper discussion, formal critique, collaborative refinement, or potential alignment with standards efforts → feel free to **contact the lead directly** (Federico Blanco Sánchez-Llanos).
- We will actively reach out to academic institutions, standards bodies (e.g., ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42, NIST AI Risk Management Framework contributors, emerging AI safety consortia), and industry leaders to refine and formalize elements of the framework.

We particularly welcome:

- Parallel research on enforcement primitives or runtime constraint systems
- Feedback on the four-tier capability spectrum and governance maturity alignment
- Proposals for verifiable identity models or cross-agent verification topologies
- Insights from sovereign compute, economic throttling, or multilateral governance perspectives

Serious, focused contributions help advance this architectural exploration from conceptual foundations toward concrete, interoperable standards.

Thank you for engaging thoughtfully.
