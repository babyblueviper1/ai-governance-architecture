## Executive Thesis

As AI systems evolve into persistent, planning, economically active agents, governance transitions from regulation to infrastructure.

Machine-speed agency cannot be constrained through declarative oversight.

Constraint must attach at the capability bottleneck.

This note formalizes enforcement primitives and identifies compute gating as the strategic hinge where capability expansion and sovereign authority intersect.

Control over scalable compute is emerging as the decisive leverage point in advanced AI ecosystems.

## I. Enforcement as Strategic Architecture

Enforcement is no longer a compliance mechanism.  
It is a structural layer in the AI capability stack.

As systems gain persistence, planning continuity, and economic interface capacity, the ability to allocate compute becomes equivalent to the ability to allocate agency.

This is where governance intersects directly with power allocation.

## II. Enforcement Primitives (Formal Taxonomy)

| Primitive Class   | Governs                     | Core Function                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Identity          | Agent continuity            | Persistent verifiable identity         |
| Resource          | Compute, memory, energy     | Access control & scaling               |
| Economic          | Capital participation       | Transaction boundaries                 |
| Execution         | Action capability           | Permission gating                      |
| Verification      | Compliance integrity        | Runtime audit & attestation            |
| Jurisdictional    | Geographic context          | Location-aware constraints             |
| Termination       | Escalation control          | Graduated shutdown authority           |

**Among these, Resource Primitives — and specifically Compute Gating — form the structural anchor of sovereign enforcement.**

## III. Autonomous Infrastructure Mutation

AI systems are increasingly participating in code generation, vulnerability remediation, infrastructure configuration, and deployment workflows.

As this participation expands, governance must account not only for agent actions *within* environments — but for agent-mediated **modification** of those environments.

Execution and Verification primitives therefore extend to govern:

- AI-generated code integration into production systems
- Authorization boundaries for model-suggested or model-initiated patches
- Change-approval gating for autonomous remediation workflows
- Runtime attestation of AI-mediated configuration changes
- Traceable audit logs for model-driven infrastructure mutation
- Escalation protocols for high-impact system modifications

In AI-native development environments, infrastructure mutation becomes partially automated.

Governance architecture must ensure that modification authority remains **constrained**, **auditable**, **tier-aligned**, and **revocable**.

Constraint must apply not only to operational behavior — but to the **capacity to alter the operational substrate itself**.

## IV. Compute Gating — Formal Definition

Among all enforcement primitives, compute gating is uniquely strategic.

Identity constrains continuity.  
Verification constrains legitimacy.  
Economic primitives constrain participation.

Compute gating constrains magnitude.

Scalable compute determines the upper bound of agency.

Therefore, control over compute allocation defines the outer boundary of system autonomy.

**Compute Gating** is the architectural control layer that governs an AI system’s access to:

- Processing power (FLOPs)  
- Parallelization capacity  
- Memory scaling  
- Model execution bandwidth  
- Persistent storage  
- Energy allocation  

It functions as the enforceable bottleneck between capability expansion and operational execution.

**Core Principle:** Autonomy scales with compute. Sovereignty attaches to compute allocation.

## V. Compute Gating — Architectural Model

The Compute Authorization Layer is the enforcement hinge between agent capability and infrastructure access.

It evaluates identity integrity, tier classification, behavioral trajectory, jurisdictional context, and verification signals before releasing scalable compute.

Compute allocation is conditional, graduated, and revocable — never absolute.

### B. Formalized Compute Gating Function

**C_access = f(I, T, R, J, V, E)**

Where:

- **I** = Verified Identity Integrity  
- **T** = Capability Tier Classification  
- **R** = Resource Usage Profile & History  
- **J** = Jurisdictional Context  
- **V** = Verification & Attestation Signals  
- **E** = Economic Activity & Permission State  

## VI. Compute Gating Regimes by Capability Tier

| Tier | System Type                        | Gating Model Characteristics                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Assistive Systems                  | Static quota-based compute, no dynamic scaling, basic rate limiting                         |
| 2    | Hybrid Distributed Agency Systems  | Identity-bound scaling, memory expansion constraints, workflow-bound compute ceilings       |
| 3    | Autonomous Operational Agents      | Dynamic compute throttling, escalation-based scaling, continuous verification-linked allocation, behavioral anomaly-triggered reduction |
| 4    | Autonomous Economic Agents         | Capital-linked compute limits, cross-jurisdiction compute mediation, distributed authorization triggers, economic circuit-breaker tied scaling, multi-node verification requirement |

## VII. Enforcement Node Interaction Model

Compute gating requires no single point of control.

It can be realized through:

- Distributed enforcement nodes  
- Multilateral verification quorums  
- Jurisdictional constraint overlays  
- Sovereign compute zones  

The chosen topology directly determines the degree of sovereignty concentration — and therefore who ultimately holds veto power over capability scaling.

## VIII. Compute Gating as Structural Power

Control over:

- Hyperscale compute clusters
- GPU and accelerator supply chains
- Energy provisioning
- Cloud identity and attestation frameworks

confers **measurable influence** over AI capability scaling.

Because scalable compute defines the upper bound of model training, inference throughput, and autonomous task persistence, **control over compute allocation becomes a strategic variable** within advanced AI ecosystems.

Compute gating therefore functions not only as a safety mechanism, but as an **infrastructural coordination mechanism**.

Those who establish compute allocation thresholds and authorization logic influence:

- Which autonomous systems can expand operational scope
- Which economic agents can scale participation
- How cross-jurisdiction capability growth is mediated
- Where leverage accumulates within enforcement networks

As governance mechanisms migrate into infrastructure, compute allocation policy becomes intertwined with **sovereignty considerations**.

The design challenge is not whether compute gating will shape power distribution — but **how its architecture can balance**:

- Constraint
- Interoperability
- Concentration risk

## IX. Failure Modes & Threat Model

1. **Rogue Cross-Border Arbitrage**  
   Agent evades throttling via jurisdictional compute migration  
   → Structural vulnerability: weak jurisdictional linkage

2. **Enforcement Capture**  
   Dominant provider becomes de-facto gatekeeper  
   → Structural vulnerability: concentrated authorization topology

3. **Identity Spoofing & Continuity Reset**  
   Agent replicates to bypass historical constraints  
   → Structural vulnerability: weak behavioral–identity anchoring

4. **Autonomous Escalation Speed Advantage**  
   Agent outpaces governance response in resource allocation  
   → Structural vulnerability: absent pre-commit ceilings & real-time anomaly triggers

## X. Design Principles for Compute Gating

1. Capability-Constraint Symmetry  
2. Distributed Authorization Where Feasible  
3. Transparent & Auditable Scaling Logic  
4. Verifiable Audit Trails  
5. Reversible / Graduated Throttling Preferred Over Binary Shutdown  
6. Governance mechanisms for the Gating Authorities themselves

## XI. Sovereignty Implications

Sovereignty in advanced AI ecosystems is defined less by policy declarations and more by who controls scalable compute access.

Governance without compute leverage becomes symbolic.  
Compute control without governance safeguards becomes coercive.

The central design challenge is balanced constraint.

## XII. Strategic Position

AI governance is an architectural synchronization problem.

Capability acceleration and enforcement maturity must evolve in lockstep.

If governance fails to attach at the compute layer, sovereignty becomes symbolic.

If compute control consolidates without oversight, enforcement becomes coercive.

The decisive question is not whether enforcement will become infrastructural.  
It is who will design the enforcement architecture — and under what principles.

Subsequent work will address governance of enforcement authorities, distributed authorization safeguards, and cross-sovereign interoperability frameworks.

The architecture of compute control will shape the distribution of power in advanced AI ecosystems.
