# Design Principles — Capability-Tiered AI Governance

1. **Capability-Proportional Governance**  
   Governance must scale with structural capability:  
   - Persistence  
   - Goal continuity  
   - Tool access  
   - Economic agency  
   - Self-modification potential  

   Uniform regulatory treatment is structurally unstable.

2. **Governance as Infrastructure**  
   At higher tiers of autonomy, governance must be embedded in runtime systems.  
   Policy is insufficient without enforceable architecture.

3. **Enforcement Parity**  
   Enforcement mechanisms must operate at parity with the systems they govern.  
   Persistent agents require persistent monitoring and constraint layers.

4. **Jurisdictional Awareness**  
   AI systems increasingly operate across borders.  
   Governance architecture must support:  
   - Jurisdictional tagging  
   - Sovereign compute enforcement  
   - Cross-border compliance interoperability

5. **Identity Continuity & Auditability**  
   Persistent agents must maintain:  
   - Verifiable identity  
   - Action traceability  
   - Constraint compliance logs  

   Without continuity, enforcement collapses.

6. **Interoperable Enforcement Nodes**  
   Future ecosystems will require:  
   - Independent enforcement agents  
   - Verification networks  
   - Constraint oracles  
   - Standardized audit protocols  

   Governance must be network-aware.
